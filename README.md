## Overview

---

Inkspire is a modern, responsive personal blog platform built with React.js, designed to showcase articles and creative content. It allows users to browse blog posts, read full articles on dedicated pages, and filter posts by category or tags. The platform is structured for seamless navigation, scalability, and a polished user experience, with placeholder pages for additional sections like About, Contact.

The project leverages React Router for client-side routing, React Icons for UI elements, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Blog post data is managed statically for demo purposes but can be integrated with a backend API for dynamic content.

## Future Improvements

---

Planned enhancements to evolve Inkspire into a fully-featured blog platform:

- **Backend Integration**: Add a Node.js/Express server or Next.js API routes to handle dynamic post and comment storage.
- **Database Implementation**: Use MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (relational) for posts, comments, and user data.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Add Framer Motion animations, improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), and enhance search/filter components.
- **Additional Features**: Implement user authentication (JWT or Auth0), newsletter subscriptions, SEO optimizations (React Helmet), and progressive web app (PWA) support.

## Tech Stack

---

- **Frontend**: React 18+, React Router DOM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via className utilities)
- **Icons**: React Icons (e.g., FaArrowLeft)
